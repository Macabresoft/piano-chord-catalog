# Piano Chord Catalog

A piano chord catalog that uses integer notation and math to display finger positions for various chords. The initial focus was common triad chords, but more may come.

## Suggestions

If you really want more chord shadpes added, open an issue on the github and specify the nae of the chord shape as well as the integer notation for the chord. Or ask @macabresoft on twitter very nicely.

## Why?

This was a project to learn a little bit of angular. Sure, you could do something lame like read a book or go to some other website, or you could come look at piano chords on this beautiful web app.
